5. Find if there is a pair with a given sum in array
6. Given a sorted and rotated array, find if there is a pair with a given sum
7. Find maximum value of Sum( i*arr[i]) with only rotations on given array allowed
8. Find the Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted array. Consider an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. The array has been rotated (clockwise) k number of times. Given such an array, find the value of k.
